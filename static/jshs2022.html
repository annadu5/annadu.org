        On March 24th Anna won the First Place Scholarship at the New England Southern JSHS competition for her new phase project on converting bio fouled plastics into useful carbon materials such as graphene, diamond and nanotubes. A byproduct of her research is a new patent-pending process to create materials capable of producing highly efficient renewable energy, in remote environments such as space, extreme climates, oceanic applications and more. She intends to use these technologies to help the world meet its carbon emission net-zero goals in the coming years.
